# 🌀 DadaAndroid  
Create Dadaist poems with the Tristan Tzara method  

A poetic mobile experiment built in **Unity** — blending **chance, motion, and language** to generate original Dadaist poems inspired by Tristan Tzara’s 1920 manifesto.  

---

## 🎭 Concept
The app re-imagines the *“How to Make a Dadaist Poem”* method for the digital age.  
Using motion input and live news data, each poem emerges spontaneously — no two results are ever the same.  

> *“The poem will be like you.  
> And here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.”*  
> — Tristan Tzara

## ✂️ How to Make a Dadaist Poem (in Tzara’s words)
1. Take a newspaper.  
2. Take a pair of scissors.  
3. Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.  
4. Cut out the article.  
5. Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.  
6. Shake it gently.  
7. Take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.  
8. Copy conscientiously.
